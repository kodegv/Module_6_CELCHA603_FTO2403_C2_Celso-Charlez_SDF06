## Challenges

I really struggled to grasp the Js used in this project. I made sure to utilise the step-by-step course on Scrimba to be able to create this functioning app.
I also learnt about Firebase and how to utlilise the provided realtime database. I also made sure to update my index.js with the correct database URL! ðŸ˜Ž

## Project Aim

I didn't aim for a new and different UI for this project, as I was trying to practice with my own variables and functions. I did fail... many times, and that is when I resorted to learning along with Scrimba.

## Mood for this project

Learning about the database interaction was exciting! It feels amazing to know that my JavaScript skills are getting better and better each day! ðŸ‘Œ

## A message to my Code Coach

I **struggled**... a lot ðŸ«
